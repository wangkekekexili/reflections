When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I would like to share my projects with others, or a team is working on a
project, a remote repository is a good idea because it allows many people to watch
and modify the projects.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I'm working on my own version of an application and maybe the contents on GitHub
are not what I need.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

When there is an interesting project on GitHub that I want to add my own features
to the project, I will use fork.
I will use clone to make update my local version of the project. The project 
on GitHub may be probably updated by another team member.
When I want to add new features in my own project, I use branch to create new 
branches.
