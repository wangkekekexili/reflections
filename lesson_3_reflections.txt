When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I would like to share my projects with others, or a team is working on a
project, a remote repository is a good idea because it allows many people to watch
and modify the projects.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I'm working on my own version of an application and maybe the contents on GitHub
are not what I need.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

When there is an interesting project on GitHub that I want to add my own features
to the project, I will use fork.
I will use clone to make update my local version of the project. The project 
on GitHub may be probably updated by another team member.
When I want to add new features in my own project, I use branch to create new 
branches.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

I can gain offline access to the remote version of the project. I can choose 
whenever I like to merge the remote branch to my local branch.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Design the parts of the project ahead of time. Then, we assign these parts to 
team members and define precisely interfaces.
GitHub is much easier since we can work on the same piece of codes at the same
time and we can checkou the history to compare codes.
