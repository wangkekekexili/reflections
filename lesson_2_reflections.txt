What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates some default folder and files representing that there exists
a repository. We initialize a repository to imply that we are using Git
to manage the project.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A working directory is the directory that I'm currently working on. It 
includes a 'root' directory and all files in this directory (and subdirectories).
A repository is a history of commits.
Staging area is not the history, and it is also not the whole directory.
It allows us to modify whatever files in the working directory, but still commit
what should be a logical part.
